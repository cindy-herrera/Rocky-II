# Rocky-II


Right off the bat, one of the very first things that is different is Rocky's spending. The prize money must have gotten to his head, though Adrian seems to have remained the same with her passiveness and doesn't say no to his big spending.
Eventually Rocky realizes his spending habits can't be long-lived and ends up selling his car to his brother-in-law to help keep himself and Adrian afloat.

Rocky's poor education is highlighted when he can't read the cue cards well enough for the commercial shoots. This scene is also one of the parts of the movies that made me cringe. Makes you feel bad, man.

MOVIE DETAILS:
Something to note is the color of Apollo's boxing shorts during the fight. They are the same colors that Rocky wore when he lost the first fight.
The color on Rocky short's used on an ad were wrongly colored and could have hinted at things not going in Rocky's favor.
