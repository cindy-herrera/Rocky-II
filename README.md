# Rocky-II

This sequel left me feeling unsatisfied and squirming in my seat from Rocky's less-than-charming character development. Right off the bat, the movie starts by showing off Rocky's hoarded wealth and extravagent spending, which paints him as a changed man from his introduction in the previous movie. Adrian, however seems to be about the same, with her passive demeanor and mute personality. Still can't figure out the romance between this couple.

Though Rocky is now rolling in the big bucks, or was, he can't hide from his underprivelaged upbringing when he struggles to read cue cards for a commercial shoot. He grows frustrated, I cringe, and the scene cuts.

MOVIE DETAILS:
Something to note is the color of Apollo's boxing shorts during the fight. They are the same colors that Rocky wore when he lost the first fight.
The color on Rocky short's used on an ad were wrongly colored and could have hinted at things not going in Rocky's favor.
