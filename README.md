# Rocky-II
analysis and thoughts on the movie

One of the very first things that is different is Rocky's spending. The prize money must have gotten to his head, though Adrian seems to have remained the same. She doesn't say no to his big spending though. She's very passive.
Eventually Rocky realizes his spending habits can't be long-lived and ends up selling his car to his brother-in-law to help keep himself and Adrian afloat.

Rocky's poor education is highlighted when he can't read the cue cards well enough for the commercial shoots.
Also, a part of the movie that made me cringe. Makes you feel bad, man.
